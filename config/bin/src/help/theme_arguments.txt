  There is only one argument for the theme script: what task should be run.
  The default task is "build".
  The result is minified and uglified CSS and JS, and minified images.

  The other arguments are:
  * watch : Build the theme and then watch for changes.
  * dev : Build the theme for development (no minification and uglification...)
