  There is only one argument for the theme script: what task should be run.
  The default task is "watch".
  Watches the application for changes in the resources.

  The other arguments are:
  * build : The result is a concatenated application.
  * release : Creates a version of the application ready for a release.
  * test : Runs the karma test suite on the application.
